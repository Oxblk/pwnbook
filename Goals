Hey! 

As I have mentioned in the ReadMe.md that PwnBook is a personal repository for penetration testing notes, tools, scripts, and methodologies.
But my main goal to share this information is to help the beginners with the vast unstructured information that is very overwhelming, I have faced this issue so I thought my work might help someone!

Right now I am learning about specifically Linux, but soon I will also upload content regarding Windows, ICS pentesting, and maybe about web application testing as well! 


Goal for this repo!
